# XAT - The XIV Animation Toolkit

XAT (or, more formally titled, The XIV Animation Toolkit) is a standalone tool for manipulating animations and skeletons in Final Fantasy XIV. It provides various techniques to export, import, compress and bind animations to and from a variety of formats.

XAT aims to combine and improve on the previous disparate efforts for XIV animation tools, and is intended to be developed and supported over time.
